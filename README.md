Tracking economic and societal collapse.

This is a public resource for people to view and to contribute to.
Please do not take the information here as a matter of fact. Please do your own research.
We will try to provide links when possible.

If you would like to contribute, do so like you would contribute to any github project. [See guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

You can see a map of compiled information (where location is relevant) [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1GkD9vXAoRnIzQqEikLKG5Hr5yagySrU&usp=sharing).
I (and some selected people) will update the map regularly.

## Standards for Contributors

Use lots of links! We want this project to be easy for the layman, just like any website.
